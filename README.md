# TicTacToe

## General Description
This is my first experience with game theory, where I try to find the perfect way of playing tic tac toe with an algorithmic approach using minimax. <br>
I would usually write something like this in python, but when I had all the code written already python decided it was a good idea to limit recursion depth and kinda fucked me over. <br>
So now I'm going to try to do it with C# :)

## How it works
It doesn't (yet).
